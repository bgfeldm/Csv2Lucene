Csv2Lucene

Description:
     Csv2Lucene goal is to index a large amount of huge CSV files quickly.
     The focus is on the record level and not the file level when creating
     threads. Multi-Threading one record lines instead of files has a couple 
     of advantages when it comes to speed as well as recovery.

Requirements:
     - Quickly index a large amount of huge CSV files.
     - Thread on record lines not on files.
     
Advantages of threading on record level instead of by file:
     Largest advantage is when working on a single huge database dump file or
     the last file in a set, multiple threads are still created versus using
     a single thread per file.  Another would be a possible simpler recovery
     after application abruptly halts, since where processing a smaller set
     of files at a time; yes more then one file can be processing at a time 
     since we may be on the tail end of one file and the beginning of the next,
     or when working on the entire contents of a couple small files.
